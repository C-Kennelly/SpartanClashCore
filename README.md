# Spartan Clash

SpartanClash combines match data with Spartan Company membership to create a clan-focused leaderboard experience for avid fans of Halo 5: Guardians.  Visit the website [here](http://www.spartanclash.com).

If you want to find out more about the project and product development work, I'm posting updates on my [personal blog](https://idle-cycles.com/2017/10/upgrading-the-spartan-company/).  

# What's New?
This repository contains all the functionality of Spartan Clash, but rewritten in .NET Core.  You'll see all new feature development happening in this repository.

If you're curious about how the data gets pulled down and prepared for web consumption, you might take a look at the code in the [H5_DataPipeline repository](https://github.com/C-Kennelly/H5_DataPipeline).  It's received a number of updates recently!
