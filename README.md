# Spartan Clash

SpartanClash combines match data with Spartan Company membership to create a clan-focused leaderboard experience for avid fans of Halo 5: Guardians.  Visit the website [here](http://www.spartanclash.com).

If you want to find out more about the project, I'm posting updates [here](https://idle-cycles.com/2017/10/upgrading-the-spartan-company/).  

# What's New?
This repository contains all the functionality of Spartan Clash, but rewritten in .NET Core.  You'll see all new feature development happening in this repository.

I'm taking a step back from the code to do a little product development first, but you'll start to see changes made sometime in mid-November, if all goes well.

If you're curious about how the data gets pulled down, you might take a look at the code in [H5_DataPipeline](https://github.com/C-Kennelly/H5_DataPipeline).  If plain english is more your speed, you can also see an explanation in the [old repository](https://github.com/C-Kennelly/SpartanClash).
